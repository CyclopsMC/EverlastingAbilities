Requires CyclopsCore version 1.5.3 or higher.

Fixes:
* Remove unneeded pushing of texture attributes during gui item rendering
  This may potentially be a fix for #135
* Improve handling of empty abilities to avoid NPEs
  Just like ItemStack, Ability should not be null anymore,
  but the isEmpty method should be checked.
  Closes #136
* Add missing attributes to deobf jar
